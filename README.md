# Cool-Graphs
A collection of visually striking and insightful data visualizations built with Python.

## First Graph: The UpSet Diagram

The first graph explored in this project is the **UpSet Diagram**. 

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is an UpSet Diagram?

An UpSet diagram is a powerful alternative to traditional Venn diagrams for visualizing set intersections. It displays how different sets overlap and the frequency of those overlaps using a matrix layout and bar charts. In the context of sustainability reporting, it helps identify which companies report biodiversity as a material topic and how that intersects with other environmental metrics.  \

### ü§ò Why is it Cool?

- It clearly shows complex intersections between multiple reporting categories.
- It highlights patterns in how companies prioritize biodiversity versus other E metrics.
- It supports comparative analysis across organizations in a structured and scalable way.


#### Explore the project on GitHub:
This visualization is used in the context of comparing how different companies report under the **Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)**, with a particular focus on how they disclose **materiality for biodiversity** compared to other environmental (E) metrics. \
