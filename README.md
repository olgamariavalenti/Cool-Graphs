# Cool-Graphs
A collection of visually striking and insightful data visualizations built with Python.

## First Graph: The Upstream Graph

The first graph explored in this project is the **Upstream Graph**. This visualization is used in the context of comparing how different companies report under the **Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)**, with a particular focus on how they disclose **materiality for biodiversity** compared to other environmental (E) metrics.

### What is an Upstream Graph?

An upstream graph is a type of network or flow diagram that illustrates the sources and influences leading into a particular node or outcome. In the context of sustainability reporting, it helps trace the origin of environmental impacts and how they are reported across different companies. This makes it a powerful tool for identifying patterns, gaps, and best practices in sustainability disclosures.

### Why is it Cool?

- It reveals hidden relationships and reporting structures.
- It provides a visual comparison of biodiversity materiality versus other E metrics.
- It supports data-driven insights into corporate sustainability strategies.
